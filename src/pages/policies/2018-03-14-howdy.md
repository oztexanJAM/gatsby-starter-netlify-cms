Help, the formatting is still not working

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      | $12   |
| zebra stripes | are neat      | $1    |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |
