# Chapter 1- Ownership, Management or Control by the Governing Body (WA) Chapter 1 - Ownership, Management or Control by the Governing Body  
  

Source of Obligation  

Section 160(1)(a) of the Act requires that the governing body of \[\#schoolCAPS\] has ownership, management or control of the \[\#schoolCAPS\].  
  
Governing body  
The term 'governing body' is defined in section 150 of the Act to mean the person or body of persons that is recorded in the register as the governing body of the \[\#schoolCAPS\] or for a recognised school system, the person or body of persons that is specified as the governing body of the system.   
  
Ownership   
  
The Guide states that ownership refers to holding property in the \[\#schoolCAPS\] with the ability to transfer that property by sale or otherwise to another. \[\#schoolCAPS\]'s financial arrangements reveal the \[\#schoolCAPS\]'s legal relationship with the site, premises and infrastructure.  
  
Management  
  
  
The Guide states that management refers to the power and responsibility for organising the activities of an organisation so as to achieve set objectives. The management referred to is different from 'day-to-day management' which is the responsibility of the \[\#Principal\]. Management refers to overall management in the sense of governance, necessarily including management of the performance of the \[\#Principal\].  
  
Control  
  
The Guide defines control as the capacity to oversee and direct the operations of the \[\#schoolCAPS\]. \[\#schoolCAPS\] understands that the \[\#Principal\]'s authority is drawn from the governing body and is responsible for the day-to-day management of the \[\#schoolCAPS\].   
  
\*\[Select Alternative Policy: Legal Entity or Legal Entity Catholic Education\]\*  
  
The \[\#schoolCAPS\] is a \[insert type of legal entity e.g. incorporated association incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act 2015 (WA)\].   
  
In situations where the legal entity is unclear, the Director General may require further evidence to be satisfied that the governing body has one or more of ownership, management or control of the \[\#schoolCAPS\].  
  
We maintain a copy of the Certificate of Incorporation/Certificate of Registration of the governing body.  
  
Legal Entity  
  
\[\#CompanyName\] has a \[\#BoardTitle\] that is responsible for the management or control of the \[\#schoolCAPS\].  
  
Legal Entity Catholic Education  
  
The term 'governing body' is defined in section 150 of the Act to mean the person or body of persons that is specified as the governing body of the system.  
  
The Catholic Education Commission of WA (CECWA) is the system governing body.   
  
Catholic Education WA (CEWA) is the executive arm of the CECWA and is led by the Executive Director of Catholic Education WA who is assisted by a Director of Religious Education, a Director of Teaching & Learning, a Director of Governance & Administrative Services, a Director of Finance, Planning & School Resources, a Director of Community Engagement & Employee Services and a Director of School Improvement. This group comprises the Executive.  
  
Constitution  
  
The constitution of the governing body outlines the objects, powers, structures, roles and responsibilities of the governing body and how governance is separated from management. The constitution complies with the requirements set out in the Guide, Chapter Two. Refer to [Chapter 2 - Governing Body Constitution.][anchor0]  
  
Minutes of Meetings  
  
Accurate and correct minutes of \[\#BoardTitle\] meetings and annual general meetings are maintained in accordance with good governance principles. A sample of minutes is required to be provided to the DES when applying to renew our registration.   
  
\[OPTIONAL: Delegation of Authority: 

  
  
To facilitate the day-to-day operations of the \[\#schoolCAPS\] the \[\#BoardTitle\] has delegated its authority, with respect to the matters set out in this policy, to the \[\#Principal\] and members of the \[\#schoolCAPS\] \[\#management\].  
  
Any changes to these delegations must be approved by the \[\#BoardTitle\].\]  
  
\[OPTIONAL: INCLUDED IF DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY IS RELEVANT: Delegation Procedures  
  
Delegations are made by resolution of the \[\#BoardTitle\] and recorded in the delegation schedules approved by the \[\#BoardTitle\]  
  
The \*insert name, position of company secretary\* must prepare delegation schedules within the framework of this policy for approval by the \[\#BoardTitle\]. Delegation schedules must be updated for currency when delegated authorities are redistributed.\]
