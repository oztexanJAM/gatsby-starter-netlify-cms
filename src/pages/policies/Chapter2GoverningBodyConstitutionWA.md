# Chapter 2 - Governing Body Constitution (WA) Chapter 2- Governing Body Constitution  
  

Source of Obligation  

Section 160(1)(b) of the Act requires that the governing body of \[\#schoolCAPS\] has ownership, management or control of the \[\#schoolCAPS\].  
  
Constitution 

  
  
The Constitution of the governing body outlines the objects, powers, structure, roles and responsibilities of the governing body and how governance is separated from management. The constitution complies with the objects set out in section 3 of the Act and ensures that the governing body, through its \[\#BoardTitle\], is empowered to perform its obligations under the Act.   
  
Objects of the Act  
  
The objects of the Act relevantly include:  
  

* to recognise the right of every child in the State to receive a school education; and  
  
* to allow that education to be given in a government school, a non-government school or at home; and  
  
* to acknowledge the importance of the involvement and participation of the child's parents in the child's education.  
Preamble and Part 4 of the Act  
  
Chapter 2 of the Guide states that the preamble to the Act and Part 4 of the Act are also relevant. The Constitution complies with the information set out in those sections of the Act.   
  
Operation of the Governing Body  
  
\[\#schoolCAPS\] has a range of policies and procedures that demonstrate our commitment to governance and accountability. These include:  
  

* [Conflict of Interest Compliance Policy][anchor0]  

* [Code of Conduct Compliance Policy][anchor1]  

* [Board Succession Planning][anchor2]  

* [Procedures for Evaluating Board Performance Compliance Policy][anchor3]  

* [Board Committee Structure][anchor4]  

* [Risk Management Compliance Policy][anchor5]  
Our [Board Charter ][anchor6]also outlines the way in which the \[\#BoardTitle\] operates.   
  
Implementation  
  
\[\#companyName\] has set up a series of compliance tasks on our [Assurance System][anchor7], to ensure that key obligations under the WA Registration Standards are managed effectively.
