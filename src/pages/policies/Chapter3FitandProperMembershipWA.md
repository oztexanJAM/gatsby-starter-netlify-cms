# Fit and Proper Membership (WA) Chapter 3- Fit and proper membership  
  

Source of Obligation  

Section 160(1)(c) of the Act requires that members of the governing body are deemed fit and proper persons to operate the \[\#schoolCAPS\].  
  
Fit and Proper Persons  
  
Governing Body Members must be 'fit and proper' persons. The [Governing Body Members Policy ][anchor0]outlines the requirements for this.  
  
Register of Governing Body Members  
  
\[\#schoolCAPS\] maintains a register of all Governing Body Members including ex officio and non-voting members. The register records the role of each of their qualifications for that role and detail of a WWCC held by them. The register is contained in the [Governing Body Members Policy][anchor0]. The Register is maintained by \*insert position\*.  
  
Statutory Declaration  
  
The Chair of the \[\#BoardTitle\] must sign a statutory declaration:  
  

* relevant to their own fitness and propriety; and  
  
* confirming their assessment as to the fitness and propriety of each member.  
The [DES Statutory Declaration ][anchor1]is completed and signed on the application for renewal of registration.   
  
Relevant Relationships  
  
In order to make the Statutory Declaration, the Chair of the \[\#BoardTitle\] must obtain a statement from each Governing Body Member regarding their knowledge of the past conduct of the persons and companies with whom he or she has a relevant relationship. The [Governing Body Members Policy ][anchor0]outlines the requirements for completing this statement.  
  
Conflicts of Interest  
  
Conflicts of interest that are not effectively managed may affect the Director General's assessment of whether a \[\#member\] of the \[\#BoardTitle\] is 'fit and proper'. The Guide states that conflicts of interest, where they cannot be avoided are to be declared and the conflicted member is not permitted to participate in either the discussion or the vote on the matter about which there is a conflict of interest. The member is required to leave the meeting while the matter is considered. Refer to [Conflict of Interest Compliance Policy][anchor2].  
  
Working With Children Check  
  
\[\#members\] of the \[\#BoardTitle\] whose usual duties at the \[\#schoolCAPS\] involve or are likely to involve 'child-related work', as defined in the Working with Children (Criminal Record Checking) Act 2004 (WA) should hold a WWCC. Where a member of the governing body already has a WWCC from a previous and/or other organisation or employer, the \[\#schoolCAPS\] ensures that it is recorded as an employing authority by the WWC Screening Unit. Refer to [Child Protection - Working with Children Checks][anchor3].  
  
Implementation  
  
\[\#companyname\] has set up a series of compliance tasks on our [Assurance System][anchor4], to ensure that key obligations under the Act and Guide are managed effectively.
