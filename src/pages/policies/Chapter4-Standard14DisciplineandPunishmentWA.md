Source of Obligation  

The WA Registration Standards (Standard 14) require that:   
  

* all students receive positive guidance and encouragement towards acceptable behaviour and are given opportunities to interact and develop respectful and positive relationships with each other and with staff members and volunteers; and  
  
* the administration of permitted forms of behaviour management, discipline or punishment conforms to the principles of procedural fairness and the prohibition of unlawful discrimination.  
Our Policy  
  
\[\#CompanyName\] has developed and published policies which:  
  

* provide positive behaviour management;  
  
* impose such disciplinary measures; and  
  
* are fair, consistent and respectful.  
Our [Suspension and Expulsion Policy][anchor0] outlines:  
  

* who may suspend or expel a student;  
  
* the principles of procedural fairness as they apply to suspension and expulsions; and  
  
* considerations and notifications to be made when suspending or expelling a student.  
These policies are published \*insert location\*.  
  
Policies for Behaviour Management, Discipline and Punishment

* the \[\#schoolCAPS\]'s commitment to procedural fairness in disciplinary procedures;  
  
* expected standards of behaviour for students; and  
  
* consequences for breach of the standards, or \[\#schoolCAPS\] rules.  
Documented Evidence of Consistent and Fair Application
