Source of Obligation  

The WA Registration Standards (Standard 1) require that \[\#schoolCAPS\]'s:  
  

* curriculum is approved, accredited or recognised by the School Curriculum and Standards Authority ([SCSA][anchor0]); and  
  

* curriculum for pre-kindergarten is consistent with the principles, practice and learning outcomes of the Early Years Learning Framework.   
Curriculum Plan  
  
For pre-primary to Year 10 \[\#schoolCAPS\] has a curriculum based on the SCSA requirements, which includes learning in the areas of:  
  

* English (compulsory);  
  
* Mathematics (compulsory);  
  
* Science (compulsory);  
  
* Humanities and Social Sciences and its Environment (compulsory);  
  
* Health and Physical Education (compulsory);  
  
* Languages;  
  
* History (until Dec 2016);  
  
* Technology;  
  
* The Arts; and  
  
* Health and Physical Education.  
For Years 11 and 12, \[\#schoolCAPS\] uses the Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE).  
  
For pre-kindergarten, the Early Years Learning Framework must be used.  
  
For kindergarten, the SCSA's Kindergarten Guidelines are to be used unless \[\#schoolCAPS\] has received SCSA's approval for an alternative curriculum.  
  
The \[\#school\] has developed a Curriculum Plan, in accordance with the Western Australian Curriculum and Assessment Outline that outlines, for the relevant stages of schooling, how we meet curriculum requirements and how we meet the diverse needs of our students through adjustments to teaching and learning programs. The plan also incorporates the implementation of updated learning area components from SCSA, as and when they are required.  
  
Documentation in relation to our Curriculum Plan is maintained by \*insert position\* and located \*insert location\*.  
  
Assessment and Reporting Policy  
  
We maintain an [Assessment and Reporting Policy ][anchor1]that is designed to ensure that student achievement is recorded and communicated within the school as a basis for ongoing curriculum planning and teaching.  
  
In addition to the Assessment and Reporting Policy we maintain sample assessment tools, samples of student assessments and sample reports to parents for each year of the year levels of education provided or for selected year levels.  
  
Reports to the Governing Body  
  
The \[\#boardtitle\] receives regular advice and information regarding curriculum development, implementation and evaluation.  
  
Implementation  
  
\[\#schoolCAPS\] has set up a series of compliance tasks on our [Assurance System][anchor2], to ensure that key obligations under the WA Registration Standards are managed effectively.
